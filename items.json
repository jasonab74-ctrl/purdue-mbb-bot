The only thing I can think is the people who didn't place Purdue #1, also didn't put them #2, or likely #3 or 4 either...</p> <p>I generally think that rankings should mostly stay chalk unless there's a good/better win or everyone loses. Houston beat beheomeths Lehigh and Towson by a combined 35 points (vs. Purdue's 41), so I'm not really sure where the better win comes from to catapult them. My only thought is that &quot;contrarian&quot; voters put the sexier UConn and Duke ahead of us with Houson #1.</p> <p>I know, I know, &quot;our ranking in April is more important than November&quot;, but being #1 is something to be proud of, especially with our football team looking pitiful (but improved) each Saturday. It just sucks to have this taken away by an opaque voting system filled by voters who probably only watch most of one conference. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/McBean215\"> /u/McBean215 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Boilermakers/comments/1ottpd5/purdue_falls_to_2_on_ap_poll_with_twice_the/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

      "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>We start at the first game of the day in Rock Hill, SC, Winthrop vs. Queens at 8 am. The first bucket was scored by Winthrop’s Isaiah Wilson 36 seconds into the game, which made him the highest single-game scorer in the 2025-26 college basketball season. He would be joined a minute and a half later by Queens’ Avantae Parker. Both would lose the record just 23 seconds later when Winthrop’s Kody Clouet buried the first three-pointer of the game, and this record was tied by the Eagles’ Daylen Berry a minute later, and then the Royals’ Yoav Berman at the 15:45 mark. Berry would gain sole ownership of the record when he scored his fourth point on a free throw at the 13:39 mark. However, Berman raised the bar to six when he made another three 24 seconds later. Parker would tie him at the 9:43 mark after a pair of free throws, as well Berry at the 9:03 mark when he did the same, and Clouet at the 8:16 mark with a three. Berry would raise the bar to nine points when he made a three at the 7:48 mark to put the Eagles up 25-16. He would not relinquish this for the rest of the game, as he scored 23 points to give Winthrop an 81-74 victory over Queens.</p> <p>This record would not stand for long though, as it would be broken the very next game in Rock Hill. Frank Mitchell scored a free throw with five seconds left to push the bar to 24 and secure St. Bonaventure’s victory over Bradley 69-63. This was around 1 pm EST, but it would take under an hour for the record to be broken when Lamar played non-D1 Texas A&amp;M San Antonio. With 4:12 remaining in the game, the Cardinal’s Jayden Gambrell would hit a three to score 27 points on the day en route to a 93-53 win. A few hours later the record would be broken yet again a rockfight between Northern Arizona and Drake. With 2:42 left, NAU’s Zack Davidson scored a jumper that gave him 29 points, but wasn’t enough to defeat Drake, who survived 77-71.</p> <p>Now onto the night games, starting with McNeese against non-D1 Championship Christian. With 10:56 to go (presumably about 8 pm EST), Larry Johnson scored his 30th point off a free throw. The Cowboys routed their lesser opponents 127-65. Just half an hour later, Buffalo finished up a MAC-SBC showdown against Southern Miss. Ryan Sabol scored a pair of free throws to put the Bulls up 85-79 with a few seconds remaining, which was the final. This set the benchmark at 32 points. An hour later, Samford’s Jadin Booth made a three pointer with 45 seconds left to increase the record to 34, although the Bulldogs fell to Tulane 72-85.</p> <p>Booth’s record would end up surviving day 2, but on day 3 it was ousted. Mississippi Valley State, the literal worst team in KenPom, was playing its legendary rival, the non-D1 Mississippi University for Women. Michael James scored a triple with under a minute left to score 35 points to push the Delta Devils to a 97-61 win. They also kept the record through a full day, but on day 5, Incarnate Word’s Harrison Read would up it to 36 with a minute left to beat non-D1 Harrison Christian 104-60 around 4 pm. Just over 4 hours later, college basketball staple Ohio State would take the crown. Bruce Thornton would hit a three with two minutes left to score 38 points in a 94-68 win against Purdue Fort Wayne. Thornton’s record would survive the night and the next day, but on day 7, the Vermont Catamounts took advantage of not one but two overtimes to claim the title. TJ Long made an and-1 free throw with a minute and a half left to drop 40 on Brown in an instant classic to power the Catamounts to an 89-84 win. After just one week, we have had 15 changes of the D1 scoring record. Time will only tell when this is broken again, and if we have someone break 45 or even 50 points soon! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Meanteenbirder\"> /u/Meanteenbirder </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1oto2s4/week_1_of_the_race_for_the_highest_singlegame/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1oto2s4/week_1_of_the_race_for_the_highest_singlegame/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The Buckeyes slowly and surely cut the defense up into pieces. </li> <li>Ryan Browne continues to play hard. Unfirtunetly he also continues to struggle with ball accuracy. On one hand, I'm still hopeful Ryan Browne con learn some more and build up for next season. On the other hand, Malachi Singleton needs more reps.</li> <li>On the bright side, The Boilermakers played very disciplin ina way. Just 2 penalties for 13 yards.</li> <li>Well The #1 team in the land won and the game was over as soon as OSU scored the first touchdown. Coach Barry odom is working as hard as he can to motivate this team. He's got his hands full and his work cut out for him rebuilding this program from the ground up.
